<h1 class="h2 text-center pt-3 pb-5">Call for Submissions</h1>

We invite researchers to submit work in any of the areas covered by the title, as well as the following:

- Modeling of data that varies across space and time
- Methods for deciding where to gather data
- Bayesian optimization
- Active learning
- Probabilistic numerics
- Probabilistic modeling of dynamical systems
- Applications of the above to epidemiology, environmental sciences, socioeconomic sciences, engineering, and other areas

A submission should be made in the form of a short 4-page extended abstract using the [workshop's LaTeX style](assets/gpsmdms_2022.sty).
Manuscripts should be anonymized in accordance with the [same rules as NeurIPS papers](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2022/CallForPapers).
References and appendices can extend as far beyond the 4-page limit as needed: we encourage use of BibLaTeX.
If the submitted work has previously appeared in a journal or refereed workshop or conference proceedings, including the current NeurIPS proceedings to be published, the workshop submission should extend the previous work.

Code of conduct: participants must agree to the <a href="https://neurips.cc/public/CodeOfConduct">code of conduct for NeurIPS</a>.

Travel support: to encourage in-person participation for students with accepted papers who need financial aid for travel, we offer a limited number of travel awards. Please submit an application to be considered: https://forms.gle/aMCphghyfMjhDkUb6.
